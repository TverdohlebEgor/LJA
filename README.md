# LJA
Lama Java Annotation


# General philosophy
As with most of my projects, this one was a cool idea that I wanted to code for the sake of coding, not for practical use. While my projects don't serve a real purpose on their own, I intend to use them within other projects. I often avoid mainstream solutions because they're too convenient for my taste. If you've found this repository and wish to use it, proceed at your own risk

Also, don't expect the development to follow any strict regimen, as my energy for extra coding projects is very sporadic. Specifically for Java.

For java things I usually create "plug-and-play" solutions because I find setting up a remote repository annoying (though I may do so in the future to learn). As a result, you might find copied code throughout the project, but I only include JAR files once I'm reasonably sure they're stable.

# Project philosophy
I wanted to craete some java annotation to understand how they work. Also I don't want to use a build system just to make it a bit more intersting and avoid any depencies (Because you can't use compile annotation without exporting them as JAR)
